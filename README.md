# Digital-clock
The aim of this project is to develop a digital clock that prints the current time, and date on the linux terminal. Its color can be changed using an argument to the program. This was done as a part of the course CO222 Programming Methodology

## Inputs:
_Command-line arguments:_


If a colour is given as an argument to the program with the ‘-c’ flag, the program prints the clock using the given colour. If no argument is given, it displays black and white as default. Other available colors are ; black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan
